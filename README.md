# Slider Control Maker Maya Tool

This tool automates the slider control creation process in Maya. It generates NURBs polygon UI and uses driven keys to connect the slider translation to the selected controls.
I created this tool as some people like the option to have rig controls as sliders off to the side for easier access especially for facial controls. I tested and applied this tool to the Morpheus Rig created by Josh Burton, downloaded from his website http://www.joshburton.com/projects/morpheus.asp
